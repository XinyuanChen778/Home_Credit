  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a data science and analytics professional with skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and business analysis. 
    My technical background includes Python, R, SQL, XGBoost, LightGBM, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.
  </p>

  <h2>Project: <a href="https://github.com/XinyuanChen778/Home_Credit" target="_blank">Home Credit Default Risk Prediction</a></h2>

  <h3>Summary of Business Problem and Project Objective</h3>
  <p>
    Home Credit Group provides loans to individuals who often have limited or no credit history. 
    Traditional credit scoring methods are not reliable for these customers. 
    The objective of the project was to build a machine learning model that predicts the probability of loan repayment 
    using alternative data sources such as telecom usage, past payment behavior, and credit bureau records.
  </p>

  <h3>Group's Solution to the Business Problem</h3>
  <p>
    As a team, we performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and model development. 
    We built and tuned LightGBM and XGBoost models to create a predictive solution. 
    Our final model could be deployed for real-time applicant risk evaluation, supporting smarter loan approvals.
  </p>

  <h3>My Contribution to the Project</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify important features and risk patterns across datasets.</li>
    <li>Created new features related to payment history, credit utilization, and applicant behavior.</li>
    <li>Independently developed and tuned LightGBM and XGBoost models to maximize AUC scores.</li>
    <li>Documented individual work in <code>EDA.Rmd</code> and <code>Model.Rmd</code> files.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Business Value of the Solution</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>More loans approved safely:</strong> The model identifies reliable applicants more accurately, allowing the company to approve more loans with lower risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower default rates:</strong> Better risk prediction reduces the number of borrowers who default, protecting the company's financial health.</li>
  <li><strong>Faster decisions:</strong> Automated scoring models speed up the loan approval process, improving operational efficiency and customer experience.</li>
  <li><strong>More fairness:</strong> By using alternative data sources, the model evaluates applicants more fairly, including those without traditional credit histories.</li>
  <li><strong>Lower legal risk:</strong> Transparent and data-driven decision-making processes help reduce regulatory and legal risks related to loan approvals.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Difficulties Encountered</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing datasets with significant missing values and inconsistent records.</li>
    <li>Balancing model performance: optimizing AUC while maintaining interpretability.</li>
    <li>Selecting the most impactful features from a large number of variables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>How to apply real-world data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning workflows.</li>
    <li>How to work with LightGBM and XGBoost models for structured data prediction tasks.</li>
    <li>How to communicate technical work into business value for operational decision-making.</li>
  </ul>
