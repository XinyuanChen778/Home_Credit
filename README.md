  <h1>Home Credit Loan Repayment Prediction</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Home Credit Group offers financial services to people with limited or no credit history. 
    To improve the approval process and manage risk, this project develops a predictive model 
    that uses alternative data sources such as telecom, transactional, and behavioral information.
  </p>

  <h2>Business Problem</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce the approval of high-risk loans to lower default rates.</li>
    <li>Identify and approve more creditworthy applicants to promote financial inclusion.</li>
    <li>Enhance operational efficiency through data-driven decision-making.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Analyzed datasets like <code>application_train</code>, <code>bureau</code>, <code>POS_CASH_balance</code>, and <code>credit_card_balance</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Created features based on payment patterns, credit usage, and behavioral trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> Built and tuned predictive models using LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment Preparation:</strong> Designed a system capable of real-time loan application predictions.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Success Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>High model accuracy in predicting repayment behavior.</li>
    <li>Reduction in loan defaults.</li>
    <li>Increase in approved loans for reliable applicants.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deliverables</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering report.</li>
    <li>Full modeling code and scripts for predictions.</li>
    <li>Deployment-ready predictive model.</li>
  </ul>
